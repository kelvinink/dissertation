# Short Proposal
Real-time Cryptocurrency Analysis System

Many cryptocurrency price prediction and analysation applications have been developed in recent years. Sentiment analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in these applications. However, few of them are providing real-time prediction capabilities. In this project, we will develop a real-time streaming data analysing system that assists cryptocurrency price prediction. The development packages that we are going to use in this project includesï¼šKafka, Storm, Flink, Redis etc.
